# Advent of Code

> I am not going to answer people why I am 
> making the solution the C it is a whim 
> and As I evolve with other programming languages 
> I may or may not try to solve it using C but for now 
> C is the ray of sunshine for me 
> As you will read my solutions you question your life 
> choices. Do it at your own risk.
